# üö© Challenge #9 : ZKP - Model Verifier

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Please complete **Challenge #8** first if you haven't already, as it contains essential instructions related to all upcoming challenges.

üé´ Build a Model Verifier using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) on Arbitrum Stylus:

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è In this challenge, you'll build and deploy a smart contract that utilizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs for private model verification. You'll work with ZKP circuits, deploy them to an Arbitrum Stylus dev node, and create a frontend that allows users to generate and verify proofs! üöÄ

üåü The final deliverable is a full-stack application featuring model verification. Deploy your contract to a testnet, then build and upload your app to a public web server.

### How ZKP Integration Works
This project leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to enable private verification of model computations on Arbitrum Stylus. Here's the workflow:

1. **Circuit Design**: The ZKP logic is defined in `.circom` files (e.g., `ModelVerifier.circom`) using the Circom language. These circuits encode the rules for verification (e.g., "is y = wx + b?") without revealing the model parameters.
2. **Proof System Setup**: We use the `snarkjs` library with the Groth16 proving system to generate proving and verification keys. The trusted setup is simulated using a pre-existing `pot12_final.ptau` file.
3. **Contract Generation**: The verification key is exported to a Solidity contract (e.g., `ModelVerifier.sol`) that runs on Arbitrum Stylus, allowing on-chain verification of zk-proofs.
4. **Frontend Interaction**: The Next.js frontend uses WebAssembly (`.wasm`) outputs from Circom to generate proofs locally, which are then submitted to the deployed contract for verification.
5. **Arbitrum Stylus Advantage**: Stylus' Rust-based environment enables efficient execution of the verifier contract, reducing gas costs compared to traditional EVM-based ZKP verification.

This integration ensures privacy (model parameters remain off-chain) and scalability (proof verification is lightweight on-chain).

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone -b stylus-zkp-model-verifier https://github.com/abhi152003/speedrun_stylus.git
cd speedrun_stylus
```

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Checkpoint 1: üöÄ Start Your Dev Environment

### Step 1: Start the Nitro Dev Node

1. Ensure Docker is running on your machine. You can start Docker Desktop if it's not already running.
2. Navigate to the `cargo-stylus` folder:
   ```bash
   cd packages/cargo-stylus
   ```

3. Run the `run-dev-node.sh` script:
   ```bash
   bash run-dev-node.sh
   ```
   This script:
   - Spins up an Arbitrum Stylus Nitro dev node in Docker.
   - Deploys the `ModelVerifier.sol` contract.
   - Generates the ABI for interacting with the contract.

> The dev node will be accessible at `http://localhost:8547`.

**Important:** After deploying a contract, update the contract address in `packages/nextjs/app/modelVerifier/page.tsx`:

```ts
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "<your_new_contract_address>";
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Before running the frontend:**
> 
>    Go to the `packages/nextjs` directory:
>    ```bash
>    cd packages/nextjs
>    cp .env.example .env
>    ```

Start the development server:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

> The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000/modelVerifier](http://localhost:3000/modelVerifier).

## Checkpoint 2: üí´ Explore the Features

### Model Verifier

- **Purpose**: Prove that a linear regression model's output (y) was correctly computed as y = wx + b using secret model parameters (w and b) without revealing those parameters.
- **Circuit Logic**: The `ModelVerifier.circom` circuit takes two private inputs (w, b) and three public inputs (x, y, H). It verifies that y = wx + b and that H matches the commitment hash of the model parameters.
- **On-Chain Verification**: The generated proof is submitted to `ModelVerifier.sol` on the Stylus dev node, which uses the verification key to confirm validity.

#### Example Inputs:
- Private Inputs:
  - w (weight) = 2
  - b (bias) = 1
- Public Inputs:
  - x (input value) = 3
  - y (output value) = 7 (computed as y = wx + b = 2 * 3 + 1)
  - H (hash commitment) = [automatically computed from w and b]

The circuit will verify that:
1. The equation y = wx + b holds true (7 = 2 * 3 + 1)
2. The hash commitment H matches the provided model parameters (w, b)

*Model verification interface and process flow*

- Navigate to the "Debug Contracts" tab in the frontend.
- This feature interacts with the **Model Verifier** contract, which was generated from the `ModelVerifier.circom` circuit located in `packages/circuits`.
- Circuit generation commands:
  ```bash
  circom ModelVerifier.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
  npx snarkjs groth16 setup ModelVerifier.r1cs pot12_final.ptau ModelVerifier_0000.zkey
  npx snarkjs zkey contribute ModelVerifier_0000.zkey ModelVerifier_final.zkey --name="Contributor" -v
  npx snarkjs zkey export verificationkey ModelVerifier_final.zkey verification_key.json
  npx snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier ModelVerifier_final.zkey ModelVerifier.sol
  ```
- Input the model parameters and test values in the frontend to generate a zk-proof, which will be verified on-chain using the deployed `ModelVerifier.sol` contract.

## Checkpoint 3: üõ† Modify and Deploy Contracts

You can tinker with circuit logic by modifying files in the `packages/circuits` folder. After making changes, regenerate contracts using these commands:

```bash
circom <YourCircuit>.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym
npx snarkjs groth16 setup <YourCircuit>.r1cs pot12_final.ptau <YourCircuit>_0000.zkey
npx snarkjs zkey contribute <YourCircuit>_0000.zkey <YourCircuit>_final.zkey --name="Contributor" -v
npx snarkjs zkey export verificationkey <YourCircuit>_final.zkey verification_key.json
npx snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier <YourCircuit>_final.zkey <YourCircuit>.sol
```

Deploy new contracts by placing them in `packages/cargo-stylus/contracts` and running:

```bash
bash run-dev-node.sh
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Tips

### Fixing Line Endings for Shell Scripts on Windows (CRLF Issue)

If you encounter errors like `Command not found`, convert line endings to LF:

```bash
sudo apt install dos2unix
dos2unix run-dev-node.sh
chmod +x run-dev-node.sh
```

Run the script again:
```bash
bash run-dev-node.sh
```

## Checkpoint 4: üö¢ Ship your frontend! üöÅ

To deploy your app to Vercel:

```bash
vercel
```

Follow Vercel's instructions to get a public URL.

For production deployment:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Checkpoint 5: üìú Contract Verification

You can verify your deployed smart contract using:

```bash
cargo stylus verify -e http://127.0.0.1:8547 --deployment-tx "$deployment_tx"
```

Replace `$deployment_tx` with your deployment transaction hash.

## üöÄ Deploying to Arbitrum Sepolia

If you want to deploy your Age Verifier contract to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, follow these steps:

1. **Export your private key in the terminal**
   ```bash
   export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet
   ```

2. **Run the Sepolia Deployment Script**
   ```bash
   cd packages/cargo-stylus/zkp_age_verifier
   bash run-sepolia-deploy.sh
   ```
   This will deploy your contract to Arbitrum Sepolia and output the contract address and transaction hash.

3. **Configure the Frontend for Sepolia**
   - Go to the `packages/nextjs` directory:
     ```bash
     cd packages/nextjs
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open the `.env` file and set the following variables:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet
     ```
     Replace `your_private_key_of_your_ethereum_wallet` with your actual Ethereum wallet private key (never share this key publicly).

4. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```
   Your frontend will now connect to the Arbitrum Sepolia network and interact with your deployed contract.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Cache Your Deployed Contract for Faster, Cheaper Access

> üìñ Contracts deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia can use this command for gas benefits, time savings, and cheaper contract function calls. Our backend will benchmark and place bids on your behalf to ensure your contract is not evicted from the CacheManager contract, fully automating this process for you.

Before caching your contract, make sure you have installed the Smart Cache CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g smart-cache-cli
```

After deploying your contract to Arbitrum Sepolia, you can cache your contract address using the `smart-cache` CLI. Caching your contract enables:
- üöÄ **Faster contract function calls** by reducing lookup time
- üí∏ **Cheaper interactions** by optimizing access to contract data
- üåê **Seamless access** to your contract from any environment or system

> üí° **Info:** Both the `<address>` and `--deployed-by` flags are **mandatory** when adding a contract to the cache.

### üìù Simple Example

```bash
smart-cache add <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --deployed-by <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_WITH_WHOM_YOU_HAVE_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT>
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Example

```bash
smart-cache add 0xYourContractAddress \
  --deployed-by 0xYourWalletAddress \
  --network arbitrum-sepolia \
  --tx-hash 0xYourDeploymentTxHash \
  --name "YourContractName" \
  --version "1.0.0"
```

- `<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`: The address of your deployed contract (**required**)
- `--deployed-by`: The wallet address you used to deploy the contract (**required**)
- `--network arbitrum-sepolia`: By default, contracts are cached for the Arbitrum Sepolia network for optimal benchmarking and compatibility
- `--tx-hash`, `--name`, `--version`: Optional metadata for better organization

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** If you omit the required fields, the command will not work as expected.

> üí° For more options, run `smart-cache add --help`.
